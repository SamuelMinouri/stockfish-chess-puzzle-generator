# ♟️ Stockfish Chess Puzzle Generator  

A fully automated **chess puzzle generator** built in Python, powered by the **Stockfish engine**.  
It creates, analyzes, and exports **daily tactical puzzles** — complete with **SVG and PNG boards**, and **ready-made Twitter threads** for effortless sharing.  

---

## 🚀 Overview  

The **Stockfish Chess Puzzle Generator** streamlines the entire process — from generating raw chess positions to preparing polished, social-media-ready puzzles.  

---

## ♟️ Position Generation  

The script simulates **partial chess games** using a semi-randomized process.  
This ensures that generated positions are:  

- ✅ **Legal and realistic** — no artificial or early-game puzzles  
- 🎯 **Tactically engaging** — ideal for “Mate in 2” or “Mate in 3” problems  

**Game Simulation:**  
A new position is reached by playing a set number of random, legal moves from the initial board.  

**Depth Control:**  
The number of moves (ply) is tuned between **8–15** to ensure sufficient tactical complexity.  

---

## 🧠 Stockfish Engine Integration  

The core analytical power comes from **Stockfish**, one of the strongest open-source chess engines in existence.  

- **Mate Detection:** Focused searches for *Mate in 2* or *Mate in 3* deliver high-quality puzzles.  
- **Evaluation Depth:** Uses deep searches (depth 25+) and optimized pruning for precision and speed.

## 📦 Automated Export Pipeline  

Once a valid mate sequence is found, the generator automatically produces all the assets needed for publishing:  

| Asset | Format | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **Puzzle Board** | SVG, PNG | The initial puzzle position |
| **Solution Steps** | PNG | Step-by-step images of the solution sequence |
| **Social Media Text** | `tweet.txt` | Preformatted post for Twitter/X |
| **Metadata** | `puzzle_data.txt` | Contains FEN, UCI moves, and evaluation info |

Each generated puzzle is stored neatly in a timestamped folder under `/generated_puzzles/`.  

Example structure:  

```

/generated_puzzles/
├── day001_generated/
│   ├── 001_puzzle_start.svg
│   ├── 001_puzzle_start.png
│   ├── 001_solution_step1.png
│   ├── 001_solution_step2.png
│   ├── 001_solution_step3.png
│   ├── 001_tweet.txt
│   └── 001_puzzle_data.txt
└── puzzle_index.txt

````

The `puzzle_index.txt` file serves as a master catalog of all generated puzzles for quick access.

## ⚙️ Technical Workflow  

1. **Position Initialization:**  
   A chess board is created and random legal moves are applied.  

2. **Engine Analysis:**  
   The final FEN is sent to Stockfish to detect a forced mate (up to 3 moves).  

3. **Board Rendering:**  
   If a valid puzzle is found, an SVG board is rendered and labeled, e.g.,  
   *“White to move and mate in 2.”*  

4. **Solution Tracing:**  
   Each move in the solution sequence is rendered as a PNG image, step by step.  

5. **Packaging:**  
   All assets are saved in a new daily folder, and the index file is updated.

## 🧩 Requirements  

To use this generator, ensure the following are installed:  

### 🐍 Python Libraries  
Install dependencies with:  
```bash
pip install python-chess cairosvg
````

* **python-chess** – for move generation and UCI engine communication
* **cairosvg** – to convert SVG boards to PNG (requires Cairo graphics)

### ♟️ Stockfish Engine

Download the latest Stockfish executable from:
🔗 [https://stockfishchess.org/](https://stockfishchess.org/)

Place it in your project root, alongside `main.py`.

---

## 🖼 Example Output

After running the generator, your project directory will look like this:

```
stockfish-chess-puzzle-generator/
├── main.py
├── stockfish.exe
├── generated_puzzles/
│   ├── day001_generated/
│   │   ├── 001_puzzle_start.svg
│   │   ├── 001_solution_step3.png
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── day002_generated/
│   └── puzzle_index.txt
```

Each folder includes all visual assets, the solution, and a ready-to-post social media caption.

---

## ▶️ Running the Generator

Run the program from the project root:

```bash
python main.py
```

**Default Behavior:**

* Generates up to **200 puzzles per batch** (configurable in `main.py` via `NUM_PUZZLES`)
* Saves all results under `/generated_puzzles/`
